# Hello! I'm Amanda Arcanjo, you can also call me Arch :) #
## I transitioned into a Development career, which I'm passionate about. I'm always looking forward to learning new things, meeting new people and developing my technical and soft skills. Looking for career opportunities in Development and Software Engineering!
I've got almost a year of experience now, and work frequently with C#, .NET, Azure, XUnit, Moq, Git and less often with Jest, React, Typescript, SQL, and NodeJS in my day-to-day routine. I've also studied/practiced HTML, CSS, the Office package (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), AutoCAD and ArcGis. 
I have previous work experience as a Geologist, mainly having worked with logs and diverse types of sedimentary (mostly) analysis. 
Currently working in a development company in Belo Horizonte, Brasil. I can speak English fluently, Portuguese is my native language, and I can dab a bit in French and Spanish.
